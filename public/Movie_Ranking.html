    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
        <h3>Rambo I</h3>
            <p>My dad would never let me watch this movie when I was young. So when I finally watched it, 
                I had to look past all the bad attempts at SFX.

            </p>
        <h3>Tarzan</h3>
            <p>This is my favorite animation movie because the soundtrack was 
                written and produced by Phil Collins! What else do I have to say about it?!?</p>
        <h3>Toy Story</h3>
            <p>I watched this movie with my nephew when he was little and we enjoyed it so much that
                it has made a lasting impact.
